                      The Past tense is used to describe events which have already happened. 
                      The Present tense describes events which are happening right now or are continuous.
                      Lastly, the Future tense is used to describe events which are yet to occur."
                />

                <h3> Past Tense: </h3>
                  <Data description = "The Past tense is used to describe events which have already happened."
                        example1 = "I was sick yesterday."
                        example2 = "Before secondary school I went to Primary school"
                  />

                  <h3> Present Tense: </h3> 
                  <Data description = "As previously stated, this tense is used to events which are currently happening or things which are currently or always the case."
                        example1 = "I am on the playground"
                        example2 = "Hannah loves berries."
                    />

                   <h6>
                        This tense also talks about events which exists or happen on a regular basis.<br/><br/>
				        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example1:Example: The flash shows on TV every Monday.<br/><br/>
				        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example2:On weekends I go to bed late.<hr />
                   
                    </h6>

                    <h3> Future Tense: </h3>
                    <Data1 description = "The future tense talks about things that which are due or expected to happen in the future."
                           example = "Tomorrow I will learn how to ride a bicycle."
                    />

                    <Data1 description = "It is also used to talk about events which we think are likely to happen in the future."
                           example = " He will marry her soon."
                   />

                  <h6> Example: I will submit my assignment tomorrow, instead of next week.<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll call you when I have arrived home.
                <br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll call you when I have arrived home.
				I will call the police to arrest you.</h6> <hr />

                <h3> Continuous Tense: </h3>
                <h6> The continuous tense is used to describe events which continue for a period of time. 
                   This tense uses the <i> auxiliary </i> verb to be and the <i> present participle </i> of the main verb. </h6>
                
                <h6> Continuous tense is an aspect of the three main Tenses. Therefore, we can have: <br /><br />
                  
                     <ul>
                       <li> The <u> Past continuous: </u>  e.g. <i> I was eating </i> </li><br /><br />
                       <li>  The <u> Present Continuous:</u> e.g. <i> I am eating </i> </li><br /><br />
                       <li> The <u> Future Continuous:</u> e.g.  <i> I will be eating.</i> </li>

                     </ul>
                </h6>

                <hr />

                <h3> Perfect Tense: </h3>
                <h6> This tense talks about actions that are completed by the present or at a specific point in the future or past.<br />
                     Perfect Tense is also an aspect of the three main Tenses. Therefore, we can have:  <br /><br />

                     <ul>
                         <li> The <u> Past Perfect </u> e.g. <i> I had slept </i> </li> <br /><br />
                         <li> The <u> Present Perfect </u> e.g. <i> I have slept </i> </li> <br /><br />
                         <li> The <u> Future Perfect </u> e.g. <i> I will have slept </i> </li> <br /><br />
                     </ul>
                
                </h6>
                   </div>
